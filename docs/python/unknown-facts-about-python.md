Python 是一种广泛使用的通用高级编程语言。它主要是为了强调代码的可读性而开发的，它的语法允许程序员用更少的代码行来表达概念。Python 是一种编程语言，可以让您快速工作并更高效地集成系统。

#### 这里有一些关于 python 的有趣事实

6.  **Logic behind its name
    The language’s name isn’t about snakes, but about the popular British comedy troupe Monty Python. its creator named so because he was a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus.**
7.  ****The Zen of Python
    Tim Peters, a major contributor to the Python community, wrote `this` poem to highlight the philosophies of Python which can be read by just writing import this in the interpreter.

    ```py
    # Try to guess the result before you actually run it 
    import this 
    ```

    输出:

    ```py
    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

8.  ******Python does not require a compiler
    As a high-level and interpreted language, Python does not need a compiler. This is unlike Java and C++ which have to be compiled first before being interpreted. For Python, it relies on the application interpreter.
    The Python byte code is stored in the form of a .pyc file which is then executed by an appropriate virtual machine. This machine acts as a run-time engine of Python.******
9.  ******C and Java variants of python
    Despite being an independent programming language, Python has variants for C and Java programming languages. The C variant is known as CPython and is designed to give Python the advantages of C. One of these characteristics is in terms of performance. The variant can act both as an interpreter and at the same time as a compiler.
    The Java variant of Python is known as Jython. It brings some key aspects of Java such as productivity and enables them to run on a virtual machine.******
10.  ******Does not require braces
    Unlike Java and C++, Python does not use braces to delimit code. Indentation is mandatory with Python, which keep tracks f the code.******
11.  ******It is an open-source language
    Despite the massive popularity that enjoys, Python is an open-source language, It does not have a proprietary license that controls who uses it.
    As an open-source language, members of the Python community are allowed to make their contributions to the Python ecosystem.******
12.  ******It supports multiple assignments in one statement
    Python allows assigning the same value to multiple variables in one statement. It will also let you assign values to multiple variables at once.******
13.  ******Influence of python in JavaScript
    Python is one of the 9 languages that influenced the design of JavaScript. Others include AWK, C, HyperTalk, Java, Lua, Perl, Scheme, and Self.******
14.  ******使用 python 的大公司
    使用 Python 的一些大公司和机构有:
    NASA、脸书、IBM、谷歌、诺基亚、网飞、雅虎！地图，Quora，Hike，亚马逊，Youtube，Mozilla，优步，Dropbox，Expedia******
