# 数据科学中的 R vs Python

数据科学处理从数据源中识别、表示和提取有意义的信息，用于执行一些业务逻辑。数据科学家使用机器学习、统计、概率、线性和逻辑回归等方法来得出一些有意义的数据。找到模式和相似的组合，并根据业务逻辑破解最佳可能的路径方式，是最大的分析工作。

r、Python、SQL、SAS、Tableau、MATLAB 等。是数据科学最有用的工具之一，R 和 Python 是最常用的工具。但是，对于任何新手来说，在 R 和 Python 这两者中选择更好或最合适的一个都会变得令人困惑。让我们试着想象一下区别。

**概述:**

| R 是统计计算和图形的编程语言和自由软件环境，由 R 统计计算基金会支持。它由罗斯·伊哈卡和罗伯特·绅士设计，于 1993 年 8 月首次发布。它被统计学家和数据挖掘者广泛用于开发统计软件和数据分析。 | Python 是一种用于通用编程的解释高级编程语言。它由吉多·范·罗瑟姆创作，于 1991 年首次发行。Python 有一个非常干净简单的代码语法。它强调代码可读性，因此在 Python 中调试也要简单得多。 |

**数据科学专业:**

| r covers advanced technologies that are very useful for statistical work. CRAN text view provides you with many useful R packages. R covers everything from psychometrics, genetics to finance. On the other hand, Python only covers the most common technologies with the help of libraries like SciPy and packages like statsmodels. | R and Python are equally good at finding outliers in datasets, but Python is better at developing a web service that allows others to upload datasets and find outliers. People have built modules in Python to create websites, interact with various databases and manage users. Generally speaking, Python is a better choice to create a tool or service that uses data analysis. |

**功能:**

| r has built-in functions for data analysis. R was built by outstanding statisticians considering statistics and data analysis, so many tools added to Python from outside through packages are built in R by default. | Python is a universal programming language. Therefore, most data analysis functions are not built-in, but provided by packages like Numpy and Pandas, which are available in PyPi(Python package index). |

**关键应用领域:**

| Data visualization is a key aspect of analysis, because visualized data is the easiest to understand. R package such as ggplot2, ggvis, lattice, etc. Make it easier to visualize data in R. Python. Python is catching up with Bokeh, Matplotlib and other packages. But it is still far behind in this respect. | Python is more suitable for deep learning. Packages like lasagna, coffee, Karas, Mxnet, OpenNN, Tensor Stream, etc. Allows the development of simpler deep neural networks in Python. Although some of them, such as tensor flow, are being transplanted to R (package, such as deepnet, H2O, etc. ) But it's better in Python. |

**包的可用性:**

| r has hundreds of packages and methods to complete the necessary data science tasks. Although it allows expected perfection when completing tasks, it makes it difficult for inexperienced developers to achieve certain goals. | Python relies on several main packages, namely. Scilearn and Pandas are software packages for machine learning data analysis. It makes it easier to complete the required tasks, but it is difficult to achieve specialization. |

最终，根据需要选择最合适的语言是数据科学家本身的工作。对于统计背景，R 可能是一个更好的选择。但是对于 CS 背景甚至初学者来说，Python 是最合适的选择。但是，最好对两者都有充分的了解，因为这两者在数据科学职业生涯中都可能有用。
