# 为什么大家更喜欢有蟒蛇的硒？

[Selenium](https://www.browserstack.com/selenium) 是一套强大的工具，坚定地支持 web 应用测试自动化的快速发展。它提供了一组测试功能，这些功能是专门为 web 应用程序的测试需求而设计的。这些功能是可靠的，有助于定位用户界面元素的各种选项，并将预期结果与实际应用程序行为进行比较。它利用各种脚本语言来实现测试自动化。

Python 是一种高级的基于对象的脚本语言，以用户友好的方式设计。它使用简单的英语关键词，需要非常容易的解释。与其他编程语言相比，它几乎没有复杂的语法。

现在来看**为什么和 Python 一起使用硒的问题？**这里列出了一些原因:

*   Easy to code and read
*   Run quickly while comparing with another program.
*   Provides dynamic typing features.
*   Many programmers are used to Python as a language.
*   The API used in Python helps you connect to the browser through Selenium. The binding between python and Selenium provides a simple API to write functional tests by using Selenium WebDriver in a perceptual way. In addition, the binding also provides a very convenient API to contact [Selenium web driver](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/selenium-webdriver-tutorial) such as Firefox, Remore and so on.
*   Compared with another programming language, python language is not too lengthy and easy to sue. It is Python API that helps you connect to the browser through Selenium. Selenium can easily send python standard commands to various browsers, regardless of all changes in browser design.
*   Python, as a scripting language, runs a compiler to convert code from lines of code to anything that can be implemented and utilized.
*   Python runs very fast, using indentation to start and end blocks. Compared with other programming languages, it is simple and compact.
*   Python language is developed around a large community, and it provides a very good support system for this community. Therefore, in the process of automated testing using Selenium and python, for those who are completely unfamiliar with this language, the community is like a popular carriage.
*   Programming is also free and can be open source. Anyone who needs it can easily download it and use it freely in any environment. The whole culture, as well as the community around the language, are fans of free software.
*   In addition to all the above reasons for supporting the use of Selenium in python, another main reason for using selenium in Python is that there are various tools to extend it. The most important tool to simplify the user interface is the network driver, which is strongly bound to Python.

因此，这就是为什么现在 Selenium 主要使用 Python 作为脚本语言的几个重要原因，尽管大量其他语言也有相同的特性。
